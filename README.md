# Exercise 1: Working with Geometric Objects

This week we will practice how to create geometric objects using Shapely in Python. In this exercise, you will also need to apply your skills from the [Geo-Python course](https://geo-python.github.io). In the first set of problems (1-2) you will define your own functions for handling geometric objects. In the second set of problems (3-4), you will read in data from a file using Pandas and create geometries based on coordinate information in the input data. 


- **Exercise 1 is due by Thursday 11th of November at 5 pm**.
